# README

- `demo`: actual used code
  - `run.sh`: build and testscript
    - build: take all (SHACL) shapes
    - workflow:
      - from data you have to reach a goal: forward reasoning
        - till goal is reached or limit is reached
      - preselection: you first give all the reachable rules back by backwards reasoning
  - `choices`: files of selected step: is this needed in the server
  - `interim`: is generated by process
    - `subgoals`: if you create a subpath, it could be you don't have data yet to start the subpath
      - createdGoal: creates subgoal
      - extraRule: to create dummy data to find out which input data you need
      - block: it does not apply steps that would create the same data (eg name is added in step 1, don't ask again in step 3)

DISSECT SBO deliverables: have descriptions about gps4ic

noPermutations: makes sure you don't do any step twice, disable permutations
